# Description
A social network for the community of Ton Duc Thang University (TDTU). This is a university project in building a private social network only for TDTU residents, the main purpose of this project is to build up a place for students and university can communicate with each other through news feed, self wall and announcements. My team and I have been creating a realtime protocol by Socket.io to allow everyone can post anything like text, image and Youtube video or comment on this site in realtime. We also have allowed university's staffs to have permission in creating announcements and managing information of students and teachers. Additionally, we also have integrated the Google Sign In feature for student to sign in and File.io API to handle almost all uploading processes.
